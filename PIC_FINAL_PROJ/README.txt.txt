# ARCADE 10c

Instructions: Welcome to the Arcade! To start off, you are given one key(shown in the bottom left corner) and access to the first door. You have three lives, also shown in the bottom status bar. There is a volume button where you can mute/umute the background music.


Clicking the first door will take you inside to the first game, space runner. You might have to click on the game before using the (up, down, left, right) arrow keys to move up the screen and reach the other side while dodging the yellow dots. If you touch a yellow dot and die, you lose a life, and then you are given the option to try again, or head back to the main screen. If you make it to the other side, you gain another key and have the option to head back to the main screen, where you can advance to the next game by clicking the second door. The second game is a classic tic-tac-toe game, in which you have to get three astronauts in a row to win the game. If the computer(alien icon) wins first, or you end up in a tied match, you lose a life and are given the option to try again or head back to the main screen. If you win this game, you are given another key and can head back to the main screen to click on the third door and enter the third game, alien invasion. For this game, you may have to click on the game before using the left and right arrow keys to move, and the spacebar to shoot missiles at the enemies. You gain one point for every enemy killed(with one bullet), and need 20 points to win this final game. If an enemy touches you, you die and lose a life.


If at any point you lose all three lives, you are no longer given the option to try again or head back to the main screen. At this point you should see the flashing game over sign, and can quit the program by closing the window.
If you win all three games, you should see the winner screen, and again can quit the program by closing the window.
